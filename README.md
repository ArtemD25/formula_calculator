# formula_calculator

In this task I had to write a calculator using reverse polish notation.
The calculator parses parentheses correctly.
Provide your formula using the command line arguments. For instance: ((5-1/2*3/4^1-3)-4^3/2+5)+2

The supported operations are: *, /, +, -, ^, sin, cos, tan, atan, log10, log2, sqrt.

The calculator also works with variables. Sure, you need to provide them as command line argumants as well.
For instance: "(4+5)*x-(y/2+10)" "x=10" "y=50"
